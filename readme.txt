Advanced form builder plugin for Gutenberg. Create forms from the ground up, customize the existing ones, and style them up – all in one editor.

== Description ==

**JetFormBuilder — Form Builder plugin for Gutenberg**

A functional yet handy Form Builder plugin that lets you create, edit, and style any form type in the Gutenberg Editor. No more supplementary drag-and-drop form builders. You can now use a one-stop interface to develop a fully operative form.

JetFormBuilder allows you to build any kind of form nice and easy. Its 18 field blocks allow you to create a form from scratch or reassemble the existing one. Throw JetStyleManager into the mix and you’ll be able to style every form field. Create, customize, and style – all in Gutenberg.

== Features ==

= VARIOUS FIELD TYPES =
Find inside a total of 18 JetFormBuilder blocks colored to stand out from the crowd. You can mix and match them freely until you achieve a unique row or column layout.

= POST SUBMIT ACTIONS =
Choose from 11 available actions and set any you want to be performed after the form submitted on the frontend. From basic Send Email, Insert/Update Post, Register User, Update User, and Update Options to advanced Call Hook/Webhook, Redirect to Page, MailChimp, ActiveCampaign, and GetResponse.

= CONDITIONAL LOGIC =
You can adjust the visibility conditions of any form field. Just use the corresponding JetFormBuilder block and decide which field will be shown and when. Besides that, there’s a chance to fine-tune the way Post Submit Actions perform. You set the conditions according to which the Actions will be executed or not.

= MULTI-STEP FORM & FORM BREAK BLOCK =
Form Break allows you to tell apart the form fields creating a step-by-step frontend layout. Add a Form Progress bar that indicates the first and last form steps and shows which step the user is currently taking. 

= CALCULATED CONTENT =
Build dedicated Calculator forms or add extra functionality to any other form type. The Calculated field type will carry out basic and complex calculations real quick. 

= REPEATER FIELD =
Repeater creates an interface to add and remove a repeatable group of input elements. You can use a Repeater field to add a group of fields any number of times. Create Repeater groups to display custom data smoothly.

= HIDDEN FIELDS =
Can’t decide what to do with system fields that were not meant for users to be seen? It’s simple. Hide them. JetFormBuilder’s functionality allows you to make certain fields invisible on the frontend. 

= CUSTOM FIELD STYLES =
We integrated JetStyleManager & Gutenberg to make it possible for you to style the form fields as desired. Style settings can be applied to text, form description, required mark, and content label, too.

= BEGINNER-FRIENDLY & VISUAL =
No more confusing field rows and additional styling. Because Gutenberg is a visual editor, you can monitor the form creation process as if you were on the frontend. All field types can be found in the same place – the JetForm Fields block. And now you can add any content you want into the from layout - headings, images, sections etc.

= PAYMENT METHODS INTEGRATION =
Accept all kinds of payments securely via any of your WordPress-created forms be it one-off, recurring, fixed, variable payments, or user-entered amounts. JetFormBuilder allows linking your forms to PayPal, Stripe, or WooCommerce checkout.
