== BASIC FEATURES ==

= VARIOUS FIELD TYPES =
Find inside 21+ JetFormBuilder blocks colored to stand out from the crowd. You can mix and match them freely until you achieve a unique row or column layout.

= POST SUBMIT ACTIONS =
Choose from 12 available actions and set any you want to be performed after the form is submitted on the frontend:

- Send Email;
- Insert/Update Post;
- Register User;
- Update User;
- Update Options;
- Call Hook/Webhook;
- Redirect to Page;
- MailChimp;
- ActiveCampaign;
- GetResponse;
- And more.

= MULTI-STEP FORM & FORM BREAK BLOCK =
Use **Form Break** to build multi-step WordPress forms. Divide the fields and place them into separate tabs. Add a customizable “**Apply**” button to proceed to the next step. Enable file uploads if desired. By adding a **Form Progress** bar, you’ll indicate the form’s first, current, and last steps.

= CUSTOM FIELD STYLES =
We integrated JetStyleManager & Gutenberg to make it possible for you to <a href="https://jetformbuilder.com/features/style-overview/?utm_source=wp_org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=jetformbuilder" target="_blank">style the form fields</a> as desired. Style settings can be applied to anything in the text box, form description, required mark, and content label, too.

= BEGINNER-FRIENDLY & VISUAL =
No more confusing field rows and additional styling. Because Gutenberg is a visual editor, you can monitor the form creation process as if you were on the frontend. All field types can be found in the JetForm Fields block in the WordPress dashboard.

= STORE FORM RECORD =
Manage the entry submissions in the convenient Dashboard. Add Store Form Record post-submit action to save all the submitted forms in one place and check their status, basic data, and filled in fields’ data. Review the error’s details if any.

= PAYMENT METHODS INTEGRATION =
Accept all kinds of payments securely via any of your forms, be it one-off, recurring, fixed, variable fees, or user-entered amounts. JetFormBuilder supports WooCommerce, [Stripe, and PayPal integrations](https://jetformbuilder.com/features/how-to-configure-payment-gateways/?utm_source=wp_org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=jetformbuilder). Check the payments basic details: status, date, amount in one place in the Dashboard.

== ADVANCED JETFORMBUILDER FEATURES ==

= CONDITIONAL LOGIC =
You can adjust the visibility conditions of any form field. Just use the corresponding JetFormBuilder block and decide which field will be shown and when. Besides that, there’s a chance to fine-tune the way **Post Submit Actions** perform on the backend. You set the conditions according to which the Actions will be executed or not.

= CALCULATED CONTENT =
Build dedicated Calculator and Order forms or add extra functionality to any other form type. The Calculated field type will carry out basic and complex calculations real quick.

= REPEATER FIELD =
Repeater creates an interface to add and remove a repeatable group of input elements. You can use a Repeater field to add a group of fields any number of times. Create Repeater groups to display custom data smoothly.

= HIDDEN FIELDS =
Can’t decide what to do with system fields that were not meant for users to be seen? It’s simple. Hide them. JetFormBuilder’s functionality allows you to make a form field invisible on the frontend.

== More JetFormBuilder Features ==

- **Field Value Generator Function.** Three available functions help you generate the field values dynamically.
- **Really Hidden Fields.** Secure hidden fields by disabling HTML render.

- **Numbers range generator.** Dynamically generate a range of numbers to be used in Checkbox, Select & Radio Fields.
- **Inline fields editing.** Edit the field labels and descriptions in-place.
- **Form validation.** Check if the entered user data is correct and whether to let them proceed with the form submission or not. 
- **Form patterns.** Save time while creating a form layout? It’s possible! JetFormBuilder grants access to Form Patterns, which you can use to build contact, login & register, application, profile, booking, and subscription forms.

You can output a form on the frontend using the **JetForm** widget and style its looks, as well. As to the remaining page builders (like Divi, Oxygen, etc.), the form can be displayed via a shortcode only. To style its fields, you’ll need **<a href="https://crocoblock.com/plugins/jetstylemanager/?utm_source=wp_org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=jetformbuilder" target="_blank">JetStyleManager</a>**.

= Is it possible to create a form that allows adding/editing posts on the frontend? =

= Can I create a user registration form? =
Absolutely. You can use the **Register User** post-submit Action to create a custom registration form. This post-submit action allows you to set user metadata, as well. 

= Can the form be integrated with Zapier, Integromat, or similar third-party services? =

It is. Thanks to the <a href="https://jetformbuilder.com/features/send-email/" target="_blank">**Send Email** post-submit Action</a>, you can send any number of emails you want during any form submission. For instance, you’re able to send an email to a predefined address, the site administrator’s email, or the email address specified in one of the submitted form fields.
