== BASIC FEATURES ==

= VARIOUS FIELD TYPES =
Find inside 24+ JetFormBuilder blocks colored to stand out from the crowd. You can mix and match them freely until you achieve a unique row or column layout.

= POST SUBMIT ACTIONS =
Choose from 12 available actions and set any you want to be performed after the form is submitted on the frontend:

- Send Email;
- Insert/Update Post;
- Register User;
- Update User;
- Update Options;
- Call Hook;
- Call Webhook;
- Redirect to Page;
- MailChimp;
- ActiveCampaign;
- GetResponse;
- Save Form Record;
- And more.

= MULTI-STEP FORM & FORM BREAK BLOCK =
Use **Form Page Break** to build multi-step WordPress forms. Divide the fields and place them into separate tabs. Add a customizable “**Apply**” button to proceed to the next step. Enable file uploads if desired. By adding a **Form Progress** bar, you’ll indicate the form’s first, current, and last steps.

= CUSTOM FIELD STYLES =
We integrated JetStyleManager & Gutenberg to make it possible for you to <a href="https://jetformbuilder.com/features/style-overview/?utm_source=wp_org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=jetformbuilder" target="_blank">style the form fields</a> as desired. Style settings can be applied to anything in the text box, form description, required mark, and content label, too.

= BEGINNER-FRIENDLY & VISUAL =
No more confusing field rows and additional styling. Because Gutenberg is a visual editor, you can monitor the form creation process as if you were on the frontend. All field types can be found in the JetForm Fields block in the WordPress dashboard.

= STORE FORM RECORD =
Manage the entry submissions in the convenient Dashboard. Add Store Form Record post-submit action to save all the submitted forms in one place and check their status, basic data, and filled in fields’ data. Review the error’s details if any.

= PAYMENT METHODS INTEGRATION =
Accept all kinds of payments securely via any of your forms, be it one-off, recurring, fixed, variable fees, or user-entered amounts. JetFormBuilder supports WooCommerce, [Stripe, and PayPal integrations](https://jetformbuilder.com/features/how-to-configure-payment-gateways/?utm_source=wp_org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=jetformbuilder). Check the payments basic details: status, date, amount in one place in the Dashboard.

== ADVANCED JETFORMBUILDER FEATURES ==

= CONDITIONAL LOGIC =
You can adjust the visibility conditions of any form field. Just use the corresponding JetFormBuilder block and decide which field will be shown and when. Besides that, there’s a chance to fine-tune the way **Post Submit Actions** perform on the backend. You set the conditions according to which the Actions will be executed or not.

= CALCULATED CONTENT =
Build dedicated Calculator and Order forms or add extra functionality to any other form type. The Calculated field type will carry out basic and complex calculations real quick.

= REPEATER FIELD =
Repeater creates an interface to add and remove a repeatable group of input elements. You can use a Repeater field to add a group of fields any number of times. Create Repeater groups to display custom data smoothly.

= HIDDEN FIELDS =
Can’t decide what to do with system fields that were not meant for users to be seen? It’s simple. Hide them. JetFormBuilder’s functionality allows you to make a form field invisible on the frontend.

= MAP FIELD =
Allows adding map coordinates, longitude and latitude, and physical address itself via form to the posts, users, taxonomies or options pages.
